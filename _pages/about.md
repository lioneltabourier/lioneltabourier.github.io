I am currently an associate professor in Computer Science in the Complex Networks team of the LIP6. My research work focuses on the description and modeling of complex networks (e.g., communication networks, social networks, computer networks). I am particularly interested in exploring how to generate realistic network models, describe their dynamical evolution and analyze spreading phenomena on these structures. I am also interested in philosophy of science and specifically in the question of analogy between scientific domains.
