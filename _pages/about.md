I am currently a full professor in Computer Science in the <a href='https://www.complexnetworks.fr/'>Complex Networks team</a> of the <a href='https://www.lip6.fr/?LANG=en'>LIP6</a> (<a href='https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en'>Sorbonne Université</a>/<a href='https://www.cnrs.fr/en'>CNRS</a>).

My research work focuses on the description and modeling of complex networks (e.g., social networks, communication networks,  computer networks), I am particularly interested in investigating the societal impact of algorithms through the lens of social network analysis. 
In terms of methods, I focus on how to generate realistic network models, develop algorithms to mine their structure, describe their dynamical evolution and analyze spreading phenomena on these structures. 
I am also keen on using data mining tools and particularly graph mining tools for applications to other scientific fields: biology, ecology, archeology, ...

<!-- I am interested in science in general and post in the blog section various links I have enjoyed on various scientific topics recently. -->
