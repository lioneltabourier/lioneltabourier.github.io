I am currently an associate professor in Computer Science in the <a href='https://www.complexnetworks.fr/'>Complex Networks team</a> of the <a href='https://www.lip6.fr/?LANG=en'>LIP6</a> (<a href='https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en'>Sorbonne Universit√©</a>/<a href='https://www.cnrs.fr/en'>CNRS</a>).

My research work focuses on the description and modeling of complex networks (e.g., communication networks, social networks, computer networks).
I am particularly interested in exploring how to generate realistic network models, develop algorithms to mine their structure, describe their dynamical evolution and analyze spreading phenomena on these structures. I am also interested in using data mining tools and particularly graph mining tools for applications to other scientific fields: biology, ecology, archeology, ...

<!-- I am interested in science in general and post in the blog section various links I have enjoyed on various scientific topics recently. -->
