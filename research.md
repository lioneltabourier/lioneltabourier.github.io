# Research

My work focuses on the description and modeling of complex networks (e.g., communication networks, social networks, computer networks). I am particularly interested in exploring how to generate realistic network models, describe their dynamical evolution and analyze spreading phenomena on these structures. I am also interested in philosophy of science and specifically in the question of analogy between scientific domains.
